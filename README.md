This is CodePlus. I designed this program as a way to take notes in Computer Science class.
It allows you to write code and highlight parts of it to annotate and write notes about.
This program was written in Java, and used Java Swing and Java IO classes to supplment it.
This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of Java and general programming concepts to solve a 
problem that affected myself.

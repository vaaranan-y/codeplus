This is a note taking app I designed specifically for CS courses. It allows the user to write code that a professor may present, and annotate this code with notes and important facts taught in the lesson. This app provides more flexibility than pen and paper as the code can be edited, and it is better than just an IDE because you can now annotate specific parts of code an make notes.
